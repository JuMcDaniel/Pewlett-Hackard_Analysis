# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Technology
This project was performed in Postgres SQL with using the data to create tables.  During this project we used JOINS, WHERE statements, ORDER BY, GROUP BY and created a ERD in order to outline the tables with primary and Foreign keys. 

## Analysis of project 
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the upcoming retirement of staff especially senior staff from the company.  The four major points are as followed.

  1.  There are a lot of people retiring soon within the company.

  2.  The area of most concern is the Senior Enginee and Senior staff where there are about 25,000 people retiring from those positions.
  
  3. There is potential for mentorship opportunities and people who could mentor the next generation of leaders.  The best way to do this is to offer an incentive to start training these people with raises or stipends to progress the company as a whole.
  
  4.  This chart determined the people who could be able to participate in the mentor program; however each mentor will have to take 2-3 mentees in order to replace the people who are leaving.

Overall, there is a "silver tsunami" coming to this company; however with some careful planning and implenting mentorship programs to help improve the transition to the next generation.
